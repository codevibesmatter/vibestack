# Plan for Modularizing the Connection Module

The current `connection.ts` file (over 500 lines) is too large and should be broken down into smaller, more focused modules. Here's a proposed structure:

## New File Structure

```
src/sync/connection/
├── index.ts                 // Re-exports from other files
├── manager.ts               // Core ConnectionManager class
├── handlers.ts              // WebSocket event handlers
├── messages.ts              // Message processing logic
├── reconnection.ts          // Reconnection logic
└── types.ts                 // Connection-specific types
```

## Responsibilities by File

### `index.ts`
- Re-export everything from other modules
- Maintain backward compatibility

### `manager.ts`
- Core `ConnectionManager` class with:
  - Constructor and initialization
  - Basic connection methods (connect, disconnect)
  - State management
  - WebSocket creation

### `handlers.ts`
- WebSocket event handlers:
  - `handleOpen`
  - `handleMessage`
  - `handleClose`
  - `handleError`

### `messages.ts`
- Message processing logic:
  - Processing sync requests
  - Processing changes
  - Processing errors
  - Sending messages

### `reconnection.ts`
- Reconnection logic:
  - Periodic reconnection
  - Auto-reconnect scheduling
  - Wake-up server functionality

### `types.ts`
- Connection-specific types:
  - WebSocket message types
  - Connection state types
  - Configuration types

## Implementation Approach

1. **Create the directory structure** and empty files
2. **Move code** from `connection.ts` to appropriate files
3. **Update imports/exports** to maintain functionality
4. **Add proper documentation** to each file
5. **Test** to ensure everything works as before

## Benefits

- **Improved maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and maintain
- **Better separation of concerns**: Each file has a clear responsibility
- **Easier testing**: Smaller modules are easier to test in isolation
- **Better code organization**: Logical grouping of related functionality
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Developers can focus on one aspect at a time

## Migration Strategy

To minimize disruption, we should:

1. Create the new structure alongside the existing file
2. Gradually move functionality to the new files
3. Update imports in other files
4. Once everything is moved, replace the old file with the new structure
5. Run comprehensive tests to ensure nothing broke during the migration
