# Sync Worker Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing a Web Worker-based synchronization system. The goal is to move the WebSocket connection and sync message handling to a dedicated worker thread, improving performance and reliability while simplifying the main thread code.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **SyncWorker**: A dedicated Web Worker that handles WebSocket connections and sync message processing
2. **SyncWorkerManager**: A main thread class that communicates with the worker
3. **SyncClient**: A simplified client that delegates to the worker manager
4. **MessageHandler**: Processes sync messages received from the worker

### Communication Flow

```
Main Thread                      Worker Thread
+--------------+                 +-------------+
| Application  |                 |             |
|              |                 |             |
| +----------+ |    Messages     | +---------+ |
| |SyncWorker| | <-------------> | |WebSocket| |
| |Manager   | |                 | |Handler  | |
| +----------+ |                 | +---------+ |
|              |                 |             |
| +----------+ |                 |             |
| |Database  | |                 |             |
| |Operations| |                 |             |
| +----------+ |                 |             |
+--------------+                 +-------------+
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Worker Implementation

1. Create the basic worker file structure
2. Implement WebSocket connection handling in the worker
3. Add message passing between worker and main thread
4. Implement reconnection logic in the worker

### Phase 2: Main Thread Integration

1. Create the SyncWorkerManager class
2. Update SyncClient to use the worker manager
3. Implement message handling for sync updates
4. Connect database operations to worker messages

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

1. Test connection establishment and maintenance
2. Test sync message processing
3. Test reconnection scenarios
4. Test error handling

## Detailed Implementation

### 1. Worker File Structure

```typescript
// sync-worker.ts
// - WebSocket connection management
// - Message handling
// - Reconnection logic
// - Status reporting
```

### 2. Worker Manager

```typescript
// sync-worker-manager.ts
// - Worker initialization
// - Message passing to/from worker
// - Status tracking
// - Error handling
```

### 3. Updated SyncClient

```typescript
// client.ts
// - Simplified client that uses worker manager
// - Database integration
// - State management
```

## Message Types

### Main Thread to Worker
- `connect`: Initialize connection with parameters
- `disconnect`: Close connection
- `send_message`: Send a message to the server
- `get_status`: Request current connection status

### Worker to Main Thread
- `connected`: Connection established
- `disconnected`: Connection closed
- `message`: Received a message from server
- `error`: Error occurred
- `status`: Current connection status
- `reconnecting`: Attempting to reconnect

## Timeline

1. **Day 1**: Create worker file and basic connection handling
2. **Day 2**: Implement worker manager and message passing
3. **Day 3**: Update SyncClient and integrate with database
4. **Day 4**: Testing and refinement

## Success Criteria

1. Stable WebSocket connection maintained in worker
2. Efficient message passing between threads
3. Automatic reconnection on network issues
4. Clean error handling and reporting
5. Improved main thread performance

## Potential Challenges

1. **Worker Initialization**: Ensuring proper startup sequence
2. **Error Propagation**: Handling and reporting errors across thread boundaries
3. **Connection State**: Maintaining consistent state between threads
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring broad support for Web Workers
5. **Testing**: Creating effective tests for asynchronous worker behavior
